# Traffic Signs Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a comprehensive classification of traffic signs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes preprocessed images of various traffic signs.

## Repository Contents
- `traffic signs classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow for traffic signs classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "traffic-signs-preprocessed" from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed).

## Analysis Overview
The notebook performs the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and performing initial data exploration.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and augmentation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Model Building**: Constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for traffic signs classification.
5. **Model Training**: Training the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
7. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and suggesting future work.
